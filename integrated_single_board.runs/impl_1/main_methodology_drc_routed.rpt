LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[10]/CLR, player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[10]/CLR, player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

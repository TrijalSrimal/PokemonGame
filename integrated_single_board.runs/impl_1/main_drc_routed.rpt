2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net menu/player1/skill_b_enlarged is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin menu/player1/skill_b_reg[0][20]_i_2/O, cell menu/player1/skill_b_reg[0][20]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net menu/player2/skill_b_enlarged is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin menu/player2/skill_b_reg[0][20]_i_2/O, cell menu/player2/skill_b_reg[0][20]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/OriginX_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/OriginX_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/OriginX_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_1/O, cell player1/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/OriginX_reg[6]_i_2__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/OriginX_reg[6]_i_2__0/O, cell player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/OriginX_reg[6]_i_2__0.

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_1__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_1__0/O, cell player2/my_HP_SP_Status_Screen/color_reg[15]_i_1__0.
